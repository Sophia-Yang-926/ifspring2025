            <p>I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so</p>
            <p>I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go</p>
            <p>I didn't know nothing I was stupid</p>
            <p>I was foolish, I was lying to myself</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love</p>
            <p>Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself</p>
            <p>'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me</p>
            <p>But I thought I knew everything I never felt</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice</p>
            <p>Or have your touch and kiss your lips</p>
            <p>'Cause I don't have a choice</p>
            <p>Or what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side</p>
            <p>Right here</p>
            <p>'Cause baby</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When you left I lost a part of me</p>
            <p>It's still so hard to believe</p>
            <p>Come back baby please</p>
            <p>'Cause we belong together</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?</p>
            <p>Who's going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?</p>
            <p>Who's going to take your place?</p>
            <p>There ain't nobody better</p>
            <p>Oh, baby baby, we belong together</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I can't sleep at night, when you're on my mind</p>
            <p>Bobby Womack's on the radio</p>
            <p>Saying to me, "If you think you're lonely now"</p>
            <p>Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)</p>
            <p>I gotta change the station</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So I turn the dial trying to catch a break</p>
            <p>And then I hear Babyface</p>
            <p>I only think of you</p>
            <p>And it's breaking my heart</p>
            <p>I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm feeling all out of my element</p>
            <p>Throwing things crying trying to figure out</p>
            <p>Where the hell I went wrong</p>
            <p>Pain reflected in this song</p>
            <p>Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside</p>
            <p>I need you need you back in my life baby</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When you left I lost a part of me</p>
            <p>It's still so hard to believe</p>
            <p>Come back baby please</p>
            <p>'Cause we belong together</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?</p>
            <p>Who's going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?</p>
            <p>Who's going to take your place?</p>
            <p>There ain't nobody better</p>
            <p>Oh, baby baby, we belong together</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When you left I lost a part of me</p>
            <p>It's still so hard to believe</p>
