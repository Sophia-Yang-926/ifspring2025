    <h1>Objective</h1>
    <p>In <strong>R.E.P.O.</strong>, players assume the roles of retrieval specialists—small, bean-shaped robots tasked with infiltrating abandoned, monster-infested locations to collect valuable items. The primary objective is to meet or exceed a set monetary quota by successfully extracting these items without falling victim to the lurking dangers.</p>

  <h2>Team Dynamics</h2>
  <p>While R.E.P.O. can be played solo, it is designed for cooperative play with up to six players. Effective communication and teamwork are vital, as players must coordinate their efforts to transport bulky items, distract or evade monsters, and strategize their loot collection to meet quotas efficiently.</p>

Understanding these patterns and developing strategies to avoid or counteract them is essential for survival. Additionally, handling loot requires care, as rough handling can damage items, reducing their value or rendering them worthless. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>
