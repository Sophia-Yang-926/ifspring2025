    <h1>Monsters</h1>
    <p>Monsters are at the heart of <strong>R.E.P.O.</strong>’s gameplay. From terrifying brutes to sneaky tricksters, each monster brings unique abilities and behaviors that shape every player’s experience. Learn their traits—and how to survive them.</p>

    <h2>Monster Categories: Know What You're Up Against</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brutes</strong> – Large and powerful enemies that deal massive damage. Though slow, they are resilient and dangerous.</li>
      <li><strong>Lurkers</strong> – Hide in shadows, waiting to strike with deadly surprise attacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Swarmers</strong> – Weak alone, dangerous in numbers. They distract while others close in.</li>
      <li><strong>Specialists</strong> – Use abilities like freezing, poisoning, or summoning. Deal with them quickly or face serious consequences.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Each of the popular monsters below fits into one of these categories. Headman is a Brute due to its high damage and relentless chase. Chef is a hybrid of Lurker and Specialist, showing calm behavior before launching sudden attacks. Upscream acts as a Swarmer, pushing pressure with speed. Peeper is a Specialist with unique distraction abilities.</em></p>

    <h2>Popular Monsters</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Headman (Category: Brute)</h3>
      <p>This is exactly what it sounds like—a giant floating head. The Headman is one of the hardest monsters to run away from as it’s incredibly persistent once it notices you. Its attacking phase is evident by its widened eyes and open mouth, where it will lunge and bite you if it gets close. A single bite takes off 50HP.</p>
      <p><strong>Threat:</strong> High</p>
      <p><strong>Mostly found on:</strong> Headman Manor and McJannek Station</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chef (Category: Lurker / Specialist)</h3>
      <p>A green frog with a moustache, the Chef hops around the map in search of his next meal. He appears calm at first, but quickly switches to an aggressive state where he pulls out two bloodstained cleavers. His only mode of attack is to roll in a straight line towards you, hurting you on impact if you’re caught in the crossfire.</p>
      <p><strong>Threat:</strong> Low</p>
      <p><strong>Mostly found on:</strong> Headman Manor and Swiftbroom Academy</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Upscream (Category: Swarmer)</h3>
      <p>This creepy guy is incredibly persistent if he spots you. He only has one mode of attack, which flings you up into the air, throwing you against walls that deal 10 damage points every time he successfully gets the attack off. They’re fast and punish anyone with low stamina.</p>
      <p><strong>Threat:</strong> Medium</p>
      <p><strong>Mostly found on:</strong> Swiftbroom Academy</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Peeper (Category: Specialist)</h3>
      <p>The Peeper deals minimal damage, taking two health points every few seconds. This only happens if you’re caught in its gaze. The Peeper will pull you in, forcing you to look at it. While it doesn’t hurt much, it does distract you long enough that you might accidentally walk into a deadlier monster. The Peeper can only latch onto one player at a time and will respawn after some time.</p>
      <p><strong>Threat:</strong> Low</p>
      <p><strong>Mostly found on:</strong> McJannek Station</p>
